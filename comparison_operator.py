# Python Comparison Operators
#  are used to compare two values:
#
# Operator	Name	                    Example

# ==	    Equal	                    x == y
# !=	    Not equal	                x != y
# >	        Greater than	            x > y
# <	        Less than	                x < y
# >=	    Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# <=	    Less than or equal to	    x <= y


# Python Logical Operators
#  are used to combine conditional statements:
#
#  Operator	    Description	                                                    Example

#  and 	    Returns True if both statements are true	                    x < 5 and  x < 10
#  or	    Returns True if one of the statements is true	                x < 5 or x < 4
#  not	    Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	        not(x < 5 and x < 10)
