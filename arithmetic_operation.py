# Python Arithmetic Operators
#  are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
#
#   Operator	    Name	        Example
#       +	      Addition	         x + y
#       -	      Subtraction	     x - y
#       *	      Multiplication	 x * y
#       /	      Division	         x / y
#       %	      Modulus	         x % y
#       **        Exponentiation	 x ** y
#       //	      Floor division	 x // y
